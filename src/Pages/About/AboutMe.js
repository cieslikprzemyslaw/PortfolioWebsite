                <h3 className="about-me__title">Welcome</h3>
                <p className="about-me__text">My Name is Przemyslaw Cieslik</p>
                <p className="about-me__text">I'm a junior front end developer withour commercial experience. I spend my free time on develop my skills in JavaScript, React.</p>
                <p className="about-me__text">I'm in relationship with my beutiful girlfriend and we have beautiful wee girl. I live at home with 2 womens and with wee dog.</p>
                <h3 className="about-me__title">My story</h3>
                <p className="about-me__text">Probably everyone know movie Ironman. When I first time watched that and I have seen that beautiful AI whos help our heroes I made decision. I want to be man who can make things like that AI. </p>
                <p className="about-me__text">Unfortunetly When I was writing the first lines of code going through the course. I learned that you need to know the knowledge of higher mathematics to start writing something meaningful. I wanted this knowledge, but had no idea how to get it. So I let it go for many years.</p>
                <p className="about-me__text">I still had this thought in the back of my head that I wanted to be a programmer. Years passed, I graduated in higher math at university and started working in my own store which consumed my time.</p>
                <p className="about-me__text">One day I decided that it was over and I wanted to do what I wanted. So I flew to Scotland. In order to develop my language and so one day I sat down and thought what I wanted to do with my life. You know that voice in the back of your head that says "hey! how about what you gave up a few years ago."</p>
                <p className="about-me__text">And so here I am where I am. A man with no commercial experience who spends every evening writing code. Looking for new challenges and trying to develop in what he likes. I think this is a great time.</p>
                <h3 className="about-me__title">Besides...</h3>
                <p className="about-me__text">...I am an ordinary person who runs after dreams. I don't want to live a boring life. Wake up every morning to do what is mine or what the employer requires me to do. I want to live my life to the fullest.</p>
